        <p class="poem">
            The world is your oyster
            <br>
            What does that mean?
            <br>
            Is there a pearl hidden in every dark place?
            <br>
            Or is the world only what we want it to be
            <br>
            If we have the pearls to pay for it?
            <br>
            If we pry something open
            <br>
            That is shut tightly
            <br>
            And is dark
            <br>
            Mysterios
            <br>
            Will we always find something beautiful?
            <br>

            Not ever oyster holds a pearl.
			<br>

			Is it the promise of something beautiful
			<br>
			That keeps us searching for oysters
			<br>
			In this world?
			<br>

			Not every pearl is in an oyster.
